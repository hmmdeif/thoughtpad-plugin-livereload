[![build status][travis-image]][travis-url]
[![Test coverage][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url]

A thoughtpad plugin that responds to Javscript precompile event. It will load up primus scripts to allow the browser to respond to code changes.

## Usage

The plugin should be loaded using the [thoughtpad-plugin-manager](https://github.com/thoughtpad/thoughtpad-plugin-manager). Once this has been done then the plugin will respond to events. To use standalone:

```JavaScript
var man = require('thoughtpad-plugin-manager'),
    livereload = require('thoughtpad-plugin-livereload');

var thoughtpad = man.registerPlugins([livereload]);
thoughtpad.subscribe("javascript-precompile-complete", function (data) {
    console.log("Live reload code object here");
});
yield thoughtpad.notify("javascript-precompile-request", {});
```

N.B. This plugin is for local development only and therefore will connect by default to `ws:\\localhost:8080` and send updates to the browser that way. In production the thoughtpad application should be used to build the sites when it needs to, rather than to listen for the changes.

## Tests

Ensure you have globally installed mocha - `npm -g install mocha`. Then you can run:

`mocha`

Alternatively if you are in a *NIX environment `npm test` will run the tests plus coverage data.
